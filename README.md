# urcl-comp-1
My entry for URCL competition #1: tic-tac-toe

It's written in URSL. To install the URSL compiler, first [make sure you have rust installed](https://rustup.rs), then run the following command:

```ps1
$ cargo install --git "https://github.com/Terrain2/URSL"
```

You can compile my code using the following commands:

```ps1
$ ursl -i "tictactoe.ursl" -o "tictactoe.urcl" -asC
```
